# Project Context for Claude Code

## User Preferences & Development Philosophy

### Simplicity First
- **Minimal codebase**: Target 50-100 lines total
- **Few dependencies**: Use 3rd party libraries to minimize custom code
- **Personal use only**: No enterprise features or complex error handling
- **Safe environment**: Development is for personal use in trusted settings

### Technical Preferences
- **Python + Tkinter**: Chosen for simplicity and minimal dependencies
- **Leverage existing libraries**: PyMuPDF and Pillow for PDF processing
- **Windows-focused**: Primary development and usage environment
- **No over-engineering**: Avoid complex patterns, just functional code

### Development Approach
- **Incremental**: Build in small, working phases
- **Practical**: Focus on "it works" over "it's perfect"
- **Minimal UI**: Simple browse button interface
- **Direct implementation**: Skip advanced architecture patterns

## Key Constraints
- Keep it extremely simple
- Minimize code maintenance burden
- Focus on core functionality only
- No need for advanced features or robust error handling
